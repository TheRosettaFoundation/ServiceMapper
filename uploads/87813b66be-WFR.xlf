All submissions will be judged based on abstracts only in the first round.Submitting full papers for proceedings is optional.Attachements are optional at this stage. We have introduced the following active participation formats: Academic Paper Use this category in case you want to orally presnet findings of a relevant academic paper. Successfull authors will be invited to orally present or to submit a poster.Successful authors will also be invited to provide long (8 pages exluding references) or short (4 pages including references) papers for proceedings. Paper submission will be judged based on abstracts  uploading a full paper is facultative and you will be given a deadline for proceedings in due course.Papers at the initial submission stage should be formatted as a 2 column IEEE papers (http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html)  they however do not need yet to observe the length restriction.If you published or presented the paper before  you should say so in the submission and you are also responsible for securing previous publisher's consent in case your paper is accepted for presentation/publication at FEISGILTT 2012.At the proceedings publication deadline  formatting and length restriction guidelines will be enforced. Interoperability Showcase (demo) Use this category in case you want to present a live demo of a relevant product or solution. Live demo is an obligatory part of this category presentation.Presented systems can be mature prototypes or products.Marketing statements are strongly discouraged.Presenter should be able to explain and demostrate at the technical level  why and that the presented solution is relevant for the conference.Cooperations of multiple subjects demonstrating interoperability based on multiple open standards are encouraged.Showcase demo presenters should state upfront if they also want to publish an informative paper in the proceedings in case of acceptance.Short and long papers published along with demos will need to fulfill the same pubslishing requirements as Academic papers (see above).Publishing a paper with a demo is encouraged but by no means a requirement. Case Study Use this category in case you want to give a presentation of an industry application of open standards  successful or 'lessons learnt' :-). This cetegory won't be judged with academic rigor.You may want to present a short demo  as well  but it is not a requirement.Cooperations of multiple subjects demonstrating interoperability based on multiple open standards are encouraged.If you want to publish a paper in proceedings  you should NOT choose this cetegory of submission.Informative publication of slides is possible and encouraged.
